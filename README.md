# CollegeDB
This program creates a database for students attending college

As a final project for my Java course, I created a program that would create a database for all students attending college. It contains four applications.
1. BuildCollegeDB - Creates the database and pre-populates with example entries.
2. CreateMajorTable - Contains the three character major code which is PK (primary key), along with a description of the major.
3. InsertStudent - Allows for adding a student to the database by way of user input.
4. ViewTableData - Displays a report of all the students entered, along with their corresponding major.

Learned:
1. Using SQL within a Java application
2. Joining data together
